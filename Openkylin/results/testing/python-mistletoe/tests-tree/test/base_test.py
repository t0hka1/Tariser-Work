        Note: Use this as a decorator on a test function with an empty body.
        This is a realization of the "convention over configuration"
        practice. You only need to define a unique ``sampleOutputExtension`` within your
        test case setup, in addition to the ``renderer`` under the test of course.

        asserts that the renderer output is equal to content stored in another file.
